## Introduction
This project is part of the Machine Learning exam for the Master's degree in Computer Science at Bicocca University.

The primary objective of this project is to develop and compare two supervised learning models using a specific dataset.

## Project Overview
In this project, we have developed two supervised learning models: a Decision Tree and a Neural Network.

These models have been trained and evaluated on a dataset to accomplish a classification task.

## Dataset

The dataset chosen for this project is www.kaggle.com/datasets/kukuroo3/body-signal-of-smoking. It was selected due to its relevance to the domain and suitability for demonstrating the capabilities of the chosen machine learning algorithms. The dataset comprises 27 features for over 50000 values.

## Models
We used two models, Decision Tree and Neural Network and both with and without the PCA.
